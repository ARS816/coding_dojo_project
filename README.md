# Truth or Dare Web Application

This was a project for my software development bootcamp at Coding Dojo. It is a web application that puts a positive spin on the classic game truth or dare. The application is built using Flask and Python.

## Features

- User registration and login: Users can create an account and log in to the application using their credentials.
- Truth questions: Users can ask and answer truth questions.
- Dare challenges: Users can propose and complete dare challenges.
